# TODO List

## Planning

- [ ] Monte Carlo simulation for autonomous vehicles
- [ ] Priority queue that supports element priority update
- [ ] RRT and RRT* with Dubins model  
- [*] Remove the requirement of friendship inside Graph_t for search algorithms
- [*] Remove dependency on OpenCV (now only visualization depends on OpenCV)
- [*] Road network model
- [*] Iterators for Vertex_t and Edge_t

## Control

- [ ] Kalman filter for RC Car

## Simulation

- [ ] Finish RC Car simulation interface

## Visualization

- [ ] Graph visualization using Cairo
- [*] Better surface visualization
