# Library for Intelligent Vehicle Navigation

This repository contains a collection of software for study and research on autonomous vehicles.

Note: this project is built on top of a number of open-source packages and is the result of my work from past a few years during my graduate study. I'm in the process of cleaning up the code and hopefully it would also be useful for others.
